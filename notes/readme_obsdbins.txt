git: for LINUX, i like git-kraken...  for WIN, it is ok-ish...
for bsd, im still just using cmd-line (and that is fallback for all)...

the two-important files in this directory are snap_SHA256.sh which
auto-downloads -current for -machine into /tmp...
alongside cvsup.sh, they should be sym-linked (ln -s git-dir/file ~/bin/.)
so that they will become updated upon every git-pull update...

even tho this directory/repository/readme are
initially being created on a win10-machine,
the datafiles that will be tracked are for obsd...

in particular, it was saved on LEK7Q4V (win10-64)
on the G: drive (created from google-drive residing
at hfeltonadmin/hfelton.com) using tutorial from: 
https://techstreams.github.io/2016/09/07/google-drive-as-simple-git-host/

need: git (used http://git-scm.com/download/win)
gdrive (used https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/googledrivefilestream.exe)
notepad++ (used with CAREFUL install of git-win)

tbd: tortoisegit (saving as-is, storing as-is)...
